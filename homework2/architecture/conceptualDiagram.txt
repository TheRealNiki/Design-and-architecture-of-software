Conceptual Architecture Diagram

The Client UI represents the user interface that allows users to interact with the application.
It communicates with the Web Server to send requests and displays the responses.
The Web Server is the central component that interacts with the Client UI and handles HTTP requests.
It serves as the gateway for user requests and communicates with the Database and the Data Scraper.
Also, it ensures that users can access the stock data, view dashboards, and interact with the application.
The Scheduler automates tasks at specified intervals, like scraping new data or updating historical stock prices.
It triggers the Scraper to collect data from the Macedonian Stock Exchange (MSE) Website and ensures that the application remains up-to-date without requiring manual intervention.
The Scraper is responsible for scraping data from the MSE Website.
It fetches issuer information, stock prices, historical data and other relevant data from the website.
Also, it passes the scraped data to the Data Retrieval component.
The Data Retrieval component is responsible for fetching missing or updated stock data.
It retrieves historicaldata from the MSE Website.
The Data Cleaning component processes the raw stock data to ensure it is accurate and complete.
It fills in missing data, removes duplicates, and handles inconsisencies in the scraped data.
The Data Transformation component prepares the cleaned data for storage in the Database.
It ensures that the data conforms to the correct format for the database by using the Data Formatter.
The Database stores all the cleaned, transformed data about issuers, stock prices and historical trading data.
It also serves as the central data repository for the application.
The Macedonian Stock Exchange Website is the external source of stock data, which the Scraper accesses to collect the data.
It contains the list of issuers, historical stock prices, and other relevant financial information.
