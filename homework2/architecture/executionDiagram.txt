Execution Architecture Diagram

The diagram is contained within a hardware boundary, which represents the physical
machine or cloud infrastructure where the processes and components of the system are running.
Inside the hardware boundary, the Database subsystem is placed as a concurrent subsystem. 
It holds all the stock data that has been scraped, cleaned, and transformed, and is accessible by the processes.

Processes
Web Server:
This process handles incoming HTTP requests from users.
It synchronously communicates with the Database to retrieve data.
After receiving a request, it will respond to the user by retrieving the stock data.
Scheduler:
The Scheduler is responsible for initiating periodic tasks, such as scraping stock data.
It communicates asynchronously with the Scraper process, triggering it to start fetching the latest stock data from the Macedonian Stock Exchange.
Scraper:
The Scraper process, when triggered by the Scheduler, retrieves stock data from the Macedonian Stock Exchange website.
After scraping, it sends a callback to the Data Cleaning process, notifying it that the data is ready for cleaning.
Data Cleaning:
This process receives data from the Scraper and cleans it.
Once cleaning is completed, it communicates asynchronously with the Data Transformation process.
Data Transformation:
After cleaning, this process formats the data into the structure needed for database storage.
It synchronously interacts with the Database to store the transformed data.
